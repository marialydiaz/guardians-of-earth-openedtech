# Guardians of the Earth 🌍

This repository hosts an educational project developed for the
Open Technologies Competition (ELL/LAK).

## Project Description
Students of 2nd Grade act as "Guardians of the Earth" and explore
real environmental issues in their school and local community.
The project combines environmental education, active citizenship,
open digital tools and educational robotics (Bee-Bot).

## Open technologies & documentation

The educational activities were implemented in a real primary school classroom
using age-appropriate digital and physical tools.

For the purposes of openness, reproducibility and dissemination,
all final educational materials and project documentation are produced
and shared using free and open technologies:

- Markdown & GitHub (open documentation)
- GitHub Pages (open public project site)
- Free and open file formats (PDF, images)

Additional classroom-support tools (used during implementation):
- Google Forms (student reflection)
- Canva / Padlet (visual and collaborative support)
- Bee-Bot (educational robotics as a decision-making simulator)


## Educational Goals
- Environmental awareness and responsibility
- Active citizenship and collaboration
- Computational thinking
- Student voice and self-reflection
